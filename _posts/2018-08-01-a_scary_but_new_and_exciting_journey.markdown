The question is, why did I decided to start learning code!

So a litte bit about myself and my story...

I am currently a Store Manager and Corporate Trainer for a retail company called francesca's!  For those of you who are not aware of what francesca's is, it is a women's clothing boutique that carries not just clothing but also jewelry, accessories, gift, & home decor.  I first fell into retail when I was 19 and ended up loving it and was able to move up really quick in my career.  Fashion was never really in my wheel house, but being around it full time made me fall in love with it.  Fast forward almost 10 years later, I've been able to accomplish so many things in my career that I can definitely say I am SO proud of and have been able to make a name for myself in my current company.

For those of you who may have never worked in retail or have been in a management position in retail, it is a very exhausting and draining field to be in full time 45, sometimes up to 60 hours a week (peak seasons, like the holidays!)  And as I start to realize what I want out of life, I want to be able to enjoy more time with my family that I haven't been necessarily been able to do after entering the retail world.  Barely any weekends off.  Holidays are almost impossible to find time for my family, let alone myself!

So I decided I needed a change, but it needed to be something that I am still passionate about and would still LOVE doing as a career.  Something where I could translate all the skills I learned in being a retail manager and just my overall strengths that I have within myself.  So I shared my current feelings with my husband and my family, and my dad was the one who told me about FlatIron.  My father, my brother, and so many other members of my family are in the computer technology field and I have always been somewhat familiar with it.  In my first year of college, I took a programming class arouch C++ and honeslty, really enjoyed it!  So after looking at all of my options and again really trying to figure out a career that I could be equally passionate about, I ended up here!

So like anything, starting something new is always going to be scary, but I am so excited to be starting this new journey and I can' t wait to see where it's going to take me!
